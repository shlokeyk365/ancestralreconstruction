# Enhanced Claudia Workflow: Realistic Species Distribution Simulation

## Overview
This script (`enhanced_claudia_workflow.R`) is an improved version of the original Claudia workflow for simulating and visualizing species distributions. It follows the **same step-by-step process** as the original `Claudiatools.Rmd` but incorporates more realistic ecological and evolutionary assumptions, resulting in more biologically plausible species occurrence patterns.

## Workflow Steps
The script follows these main steps:

1. **Simulate a phylogeny** using a birth-death process (Brownian motion tree)
2. **Simulate species niche traits** (center, width, height) for multiple environmental variables, using realistic trait correlations and evolutionary rates
3. **Generate environmental gradients** (temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil pH, vegetation cover) with realistic spatial patterns
4. **Scale and center environmental variables**
5. **Align trait centers to environmental means, scale and clamp to [-3, 3]**
6. **Clamp niche widths to a minimum of 1.0**
7. **Calculate species occurrence probabilities** across the landscape, using logistic regression with a gentler slope (-1) and trait-environment relationships
8. **Diagnostic output for trait/environment alignment**
9. **Plot species occurrence maps** for multiple species (same style as original Claudia workflow)
10. **Analyze and plot species richness and latitudinal diversity gradients**

## Key Enhancements Over the Original Claudia Workflow

| Feature                        | Original Claudia         | Enhanced Workflow                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Trait correlations             | Simple/uncorrelated     | Realistic, theory-based          |
| Evolutionary rates             | Same for all variables  | Variable by ecological importance, lower for centers |
| Trait center initialization    | Arbitrary/zero          | Set to environmental means       |
| Trait center scaling/clamping  | None                    | Scaled to env, clamped to [-3, 3]|
| Niche width treatment          | Unconstrained           | Clamped to [1.0, 2.5]            |
| Environmental gradients        | Simple linear/noisy     | Realistic, spatially structured  |
| Occurrence calculation         | Simple sum              | Weighted, gentler logistic slope, with noise |
| Height treatment               | Same for all variables  | Varies by environmental variable |
| Plotting & workflow            | Classic Claudia style   | Same, but with more realism      |
| Diagnostics                    | None                    | Trait/environment alignment output|

### Ecological Theory Behind Trait Correlations
- **Specialist–Generalist Trade-off:** Negative correlation between niche center and width
- **Performance–Breadth Trade-off:** Negative correlation between width and height
- **Niche Conservatism:** Weak/neutral correlation between center and height

These are reflected in the correlation matrix used for trait simulation.

## How to Use

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```r
   install.packages(c("mvMORPH", "geiger", "plotrix", "corpcor"))
   ```
2. **Run the script in R or RStudio:**
   ```r
   source("enhanced_claudia_workflow.R")
   ```
   This will generate all plots and print progress to the console, including diagnostic output for trait/environment alignment.

3. **View the plots:**
   - Environmental gradients (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
   - Species occurrence maps for 9 species
   - Species richness and latitudinal diversity gradient

## Output
- **Plots**: Maps of environmental gradients, species occurrences, and richness
- **Console output**: Progress messages and diagnostics for each step

## Customization
- **Change the number of species**: Edit `n=100` in the phylogeny simulation
- **Change environmental resolution**: Edit the `lat` and `long` sequences
- **Adjust trait correlations or evolutionary rates**: Edit the `corSig` matrix and `R_sd_*` vectors
- **Modify noise or interaction strength**: Edit the `noise_level` or add more complexity to the occurrence calculation

## Interpretation and Diagnostics
- The workflow now prints the range of trait centers (after scaling) and the corresponding environmental variable ranges, so you can verify trait-environment alignment.
- Occurrence probability maps should show structured, non-random patterns reflecting ecological filtering.
- If you see only noise, check the diagnostic output and adjust trait simulation or scaling as needed.
