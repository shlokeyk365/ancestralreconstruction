# Changed Claudia Workflow: Realistic Species Distribution Simulation

## Overview

This script (`enhanced_claudia_workflow.R`) is an version of the original Claudia workflow for simulating and visualizing species distributions with some additional contributions. It follows the same step by step process as the original but incorporates more realistic ecological and evolutionary assumptions, resulting in more biologically plausible species occurrence patterns.

## Workflow Steps

The script follows these main steps:

1.  **Simulate a phylogeny** using a birth-death process (Brownian motion tree)
2.  **Simulate species niche traits** (center, width, height) for multiple environmental variables, using realistic trait correlations and evolutionary rates
3.  **Generate environmental gradients** (temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil pH, vegetation cover) with realistic spatial patterns
4.  **Scale and center environmental variables**
5.  **Calculate species occurrence probabilities** across the landscape, using logistic regression and trait-environment relationships
6.  **Plot species occurrence maps** for multiple species (same style as original Claudia workflow)
7.  **Analyze and plot species richness and latitudinal diversity gradients**

## Key Enhancements Over the Original Claudia Workflow

| Feature | Original Claudia | Enhanced Workflow |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Trait correlations | Uncorrelated | Realistic, theory-based |
| Evolutionary rates | Same for all variables | Variable |
| Environmental gradients | Simple linear/noisy | Realistic, spatially structured |
| Occurrence calculation | Simple sum | Still simple, but with noise and height averaging |
| Height treatment | Same for all variables | Varies by environmental variable |
| Plotting & workflow | Classic Claudia style | Same style |

### Ecological Theory Behind Trait Correlations

-   **Specialist–Generalist Trade-off:** Negative correlation between niche center and width
-   **Performance–Breadth Trade-off:** Negative correlation between width and height
-   **Niche Conservatism:** Weak/neutral correlation between center and height

These are reflected in the correlation matrix used for trait simulation.

## How to Use

1.  **Install required packages:**

    ``` r
    install.packages(c("mvMORPH", "geiger", "plotrix", "corpcor"))
    ```

2.  **Run the script in R or RStudio:**

    ``` r
    source("enhanced_claudia_workflow.R")
    ```

    This will generate all plots and print progress to the console.

3.  **View the plots:**

    -   Environmental gradients (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
    -   Species occurrence maps for 9 species
    -   Species richness and latitudinal diversity gradient

## Output

-   **Plots**: Maps of environmental gradients, species occurrences, and richness
-   **Console output**: Progress messages for each step

## Customization

-   **Change the number of species**: Edit `n=100` in the phylogeny simulation
-   **Change environmental resolution**: Edit the `lat` and `long` sequences
-   **Adjust trait correlations or evolutionary rates**: Edit the `corSig` matrix and `R_sd_*` vectors
-   **Modify noise or interaction strength**: Edit the `noise_level` or add more complexity to the occurrence calculation
